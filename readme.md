# Starbucks Locations


This is my first experience with Basemap in Python to make world maps, using the Starbucks locations dataset from <a href = 'https://www.kaggle.com/starbucks/store-locations'>Kaggle</a>

The main file is <a href = 'https://github.com/pan-alex/starbucks_locations/blob/master/Starbucks%20Locations.ipynb'>Starbucks Locations.ipynb</a>

The other files contain original code, which I lated copied into the Jupyter Notebook.
